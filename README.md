# Cumulative Volume Delta

Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) is a custom indicator for MT4, MT5, and cTrader coded by EarnForex.com. It's main goal is to show how bullish and bearish volume accumulated over time.

The main utility of this indicator is to help in the price divergence analysis based on volume.

The MT5 version of this CVD implementation can work with real volume (in contrast to tick volume) for trading instruments that support it.
